## About Me

I am a passionate developer with a focus on front-end technologies, especially React.js & web 3. I love building intuitive and interactive user interfaces that provide a seamless user experience. I also have a keen interest in blockchain technology and its potential to revolutionize various industries.

## Projects

Here are some of the projects I have worked on:

- **Project 1**: [Domain Naming Service](https://tdns.network/): Decentralized Web 3.0 domains are the protocol managed on the blockchain through NFTs representing ownership of the URL where the actual addresses are encrypted, so that no entity on the network will ever be able to block an approved address. 
- **Project 2**: [NFT Marketplace](https://bluemoon.quecko.com/): Bluemoon is a platform for digital artists, NFT collectors, gamers, and investors worldwide to interact, host contests, and build a community. It offers AR/VR capabilities to view NFTs in personalized virtual galleries. As an NFT marketplace, Bluemoon allows unique features like NFT comparisons and swapping. Additionally, it provides an NFT Launchpad for presales to support emerging digital artists and NFT creators.
- **Project 3**: [Staking Pools Deployer](https://earn.gocryptome.io/): Staking Pools Deployer is a high-yield platform that allows the creation of staking pools with desired features. The platform then enables users to stake in the created pools and earn rewards. Asset holders can make the most of their assets through trading them, earning passive income and winning rewards. Users are allowed to stake for different time periods of 3 months, 6 months, and 1 year with rewards getting bigger with the staking time.
