## About Me

I am a passionate developer with a focus on front-end technologies, especially React.js & web 3. I love building intuitive and interactive user interfaces that provide a seamless user experience. I also have a keen interest in blockchain technology and its potential to revolutionize various industries.

## Projects

Here are some of the projects I have worked on:

- **Project 1**: [tDNS -tomi Domain Name System](https://domains.tomi.com): tDNS (tomi Domain Name System) is a decentralized domain name system built on blockchain technology and Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs), designed to give users more direct ownership, control, and security over their online domains within the tomiNet ecosystem. Unlike the centralized, traditional DNS where users rent domains, tDNS uses NFTs to represent ownership of domain names, offering enhanced privacy, security, and a new model for internet governance through a DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization). .
- **Project 2**: [DOP - Data Ownership Protocol](https://dop.org/): DOP utilizes zero-knowledge roll-ups, an off-chain protocol that moves computation and state storage off-chain to increase throughput on the Ethereum Mainnet while maintaining complete data ownership. By enabling transactions through zero-knowledge proofs, DOP reduces transaction costs and allows users to access their favorite apps on L1 while maintaining security, transparency and choice.
- **Project 3**: WIZARD GALLERY NFT MARKETPLACE: Wizard Gallery is a specialized marketplace designed for buying, owning, and selling NFTs within the Core ecosystem.
- **Project 4**: [HYDT Protocol](https://app.hydtprotocol.com/HYDT/dashboard): Discover the next level of stablecoin with High Yield Dollar Protocol- a revolutionary BSC-based project offering innovative features and high returns, maintaining a steadfast 1:1 peg to the US dollar. Experience financial growth confidently, as HYDT holders harness the best of both worlds!
