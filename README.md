## About Me

I am a passionate developer with a focus on front-end technologies, especially React.js & web 3. I love building intuitive and interactive user interfaces that provide a seamless user experience. I also have a keen interest in blockchain technology and its potential to revolutionize various industries.

## Projects

Here are some of the projects I have worked on:

- **Project 1**: [tDNS -tomi Domain Name System](https://tdns.network/): tDNS offers enhanced security and accessibility for blockchain naming, much like Ethereum Name Service (ENS). Unlike traditional DNS, which is vulnerable to hacks, ENS records are secured by the Ethereum blockchain, making them tamper-proof. Additionally, ENS simplifies interactions by enabling users to create ".tomi", and ".com" domains, providing a clear point of contact in the Ethereum network. Join us in embracing secure and user-friendly blockchain naming with tDNS.
- **Project 2**: [DOP - Data Ownership Protocol](https://dop.org/): DOP utilizes zero-knowledge roll-ups, an off-chain protocol that moves computation and state storage off-chain to increase throughput on the Ethereum Mainnet while maintaining complete data ownership. By enabling transactions through zero-knowledge proofs, DOP reduces transaction costs and allows users to access their favorite apps on L1 while maintaining security, transparency and choice.
- **Project 3**: [HYDT Protocol](https://app.hydtprotocol.com/HYDT/dashboard): Discover the next level of stablecoin with High Yield Dollar Protocol- a revolutionary BSC-based project offering innovative features and high returns, maintaining a steadfast 1:1 peg to the US dollar. Experience financial growth confidently, as HYDT holders harness the best of both worlds!
- **Project 4**: [STABL33 PROTOCOL](https://staging.stabl33.com/): Decentralized Savings Protocol Based On Non-Depreciating Digital Assets, Paying The World's Highest Returns In USDC & DAI
